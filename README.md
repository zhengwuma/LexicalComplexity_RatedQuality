# Project Description

This is the slightly changed version repository for my undergraduate thesis: Testing the Relationship of Lexical Complexity to the Rated Quality of TEM-4 Oral Narratives.

- `Dataset`: I utilized the SWECCL (Spoken and Written English Corpus of Chinese Learners) 2.0 as the corpus for my analysis. While it's a reliable dataset, it's worth noting that it's a bit old. If you're interested, you can view the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hOg6DjzHb9V43mBqEj3biWndk27vGCNR?usp=sharing). If you need further analysis, please send me email and I will share you the folders.

- `Analysis`: The lexical complexity of the samples was calculated using three NLP tools: [TAALES](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taales.html), [TAALED](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taaled.html), and [Lexical Complexity Analyzer](https://sites.psu.edu/xxl13/lca/). If you're curious about the specific functions used, refer to the 'tool_manual' folder. The script 'anova_stepwise_plot.py' encompasses the one-way ANOVA, stepwise regression, and the visualization of results.

- `Results`: This is the place I store the analysis results.

Feel free to explore the repository and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
